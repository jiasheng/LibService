                        The idea for our project came from a problem that many NUS students may face. 
                        There are essential readings that are needed for the modules that we take but the demand vastly outweighs the supply of those essential reading materials provided by the school in our school libraries.
                        Even for a module with sub-100 students, the library only has around 5 books for all the students to share.
                        These books are usually placed in the <a href="http://libfaq.nus.edu.sg/a.php?qid=10943#.U653PLGjI5Y">RBR</a> section of libraries.
                    </p>
                    <p align="center">
                        This makes it very hard for students as RBR books only allow for a 2 hour borrowing period. Thus, our project aims to ease this problem by helping students find those RBR books in the National Library Board’s public libraries, so that they can borrow them for a longer period of time.
